Number Nibbler is a free game inspired by the old PC game [Number Munchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchers#Number_Munchers). Gameplay entails moving a frog around to select the correct answers to the math questions posed on each level, while avoiding incorrect answers (and roaming alligators). Number Nibbler is available for free with no advertisements on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.david1socha.numbernibbler), [Web](https://david1socha.itch.io/number-nibbler), and [Windows](https://david1socha.itch.io/number-nibbler). 

Number Nibbler was originally developed in [Love2D](https://love2d.org/), then ported into [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). Source code is available at [Github](https://github.com/David1Socha/number-nibbler-gd).
