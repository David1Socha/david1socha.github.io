Number Nibbler is a free game inspired by the old PC game [Number Munchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchers#Number_Munchers). Gameplay entails moving a frog around to select the correct answers to the math questions posed on each level, while avoiding incorrect answers (and roaming alligators).

Number Nibbler was originally developed in [Love2D](https://love2d.org/), then ported into [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). Source code is available at [Github](https://github.com/David1Socha/number-nibbler-gd).
